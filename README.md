# Intoduction
As a result of current unstable situation of politics and economy, Sri Lanka's education sector is 
experiencing significant issues. 
Many colleges and institutions struggle to provide basic services and facilities to the students due to lack of 
funding. As a result, education has declined in quality, and many pupils are finding it difficult to keep up 
with their studies. So, to overcome this problem, our developing team has come up with the idea of an app 
called “EduX” to help the students in our country. 
With the help of various innovative tools, the "EduX" app provides students with all the educational 
support they need to advance their knowledge. This mobile application involves three principal parties. 
They are students, teachers, and donors. Students can enroll for courses and quizzes. The service that the 
teachers are offering is free, but if any donors would like to contribute money for it, they can do so 
through this app. Donating money isn’t compulsory here. Donors who want to give books for the benefit of 
students can do so through this approach. Users now have the option to create and publish blog posts 
directly from their mobile device. We have made it easy for users to write and design their blog entries, 
including photographs and videos, and to preview their work before publishing. 
Our team's ultimate objective in creating this educational application was to give users a fun and engaging 
way to learn even in the midst of a serious economic crisis in the nation, as well as to give them hope for 
their future aspirations.
